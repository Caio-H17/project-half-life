                    — Alyx Vance
                </span>

                Alyx Vance is the deuteragonist of Half-Life 2 and its Episodes and the titular protagonist of Half-Life: Alyx. A young woman in her mid-twenties, she is a prominent figure in the Resistance campaign against the rule of the Combine.
                <br>
                <br>
                As a young child, Alyx lived in the dormitories within the confines of the Black Mesa Research Facility along with her father Eli and her mother Azian, while Eli was working at the Sector C Test Labs. 
                <br>
                <br>
                When the Black Mesa Incident occurred, Eli managed to escape along with Alyx and a family picture, while Azian was killed in the incident. During the course of the incident, the G-Man was instrumental in rescuing Alyx, despite the objections of unnamed naysayers. Alyx was apparently too young to remember this (she does not recognize the G-Man when meeting him as an adult), and although Eli witnessed it, he never shared the story with her.
                <br>
                <br>
                Alyx was raised by Eli in the world controlled by the Combine, likely at Black Mesa East much of the time. During this time, Alyx was also on good terms with Isaac Kleiner, referring to him as "Uncle Kleiner" in an affectionate portrait she once offered him. During Alyx's childhood, Eli used scrap metal to create Dog, a sentient robot designed to protect her, making him physically powerful, intelligent and with an in-built sixth sense so that he could always know Alyx's whereabouts. Although the initial model was a mere meter high, Alyx added new parts to Dog over time, making him a towering 2.5 meters high at the time of Half-Life 2.
                <br>
                <br>
                As Alyx reached adulthood, she began working with the Resistance, as one of the core members of the City 17 branch. At the age of 19, she performed reconnaissance missions, and was friends with Russell and Olga. By the age of 24, she was assisting Kleiner and Barney Calhoun in helping citizens escape the city to Black Mesa East through the old Canals, as well as helping Kleiner, her father and Judith Mossman establish a teleport connection between Black Mesa East and Kleiner's Lab. She is working with this at the time of Half-Life 2.
                <br>
                <br>
                5 years before the events of Half-Life 2, Alyx was "hired" by the G-Man and placed in stasis. It's currently unknown what happened to her between the events of Half-Life Alyx and the events of Half-Life 2.
